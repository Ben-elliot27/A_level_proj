# Real-Time Strategy Game Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the documentation and visual assets for a Unity-based real-time strategy (RTS) game project developed as part of a Computer Science coursework in Autumn 2020. The project involves the creation of a 2D strategy game where players compete against an AI, mining resources, building armies, and strategically defending or attacking to destroy the opponent's castle.

**Note:** Due to compatibility issues between Unity and GitHub (and how long ago the project was last worked on), the source code for this project is not included in this repository. Instead, the repository contains the full report detailing the development process, analysis, design, and evaluation of the game, along with images showcasing various stages of the game's development.

## Features

- **Mining and Resource Management:** Players control miners to gather gold, which is used to recruit soldiers and build defensive towers.
- **Strategic Gameplay:** Players must balance offense and defense by upgrading soldiers and towers to effectively combat an increasingly challenging AI.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** The AI becomes more challenging with each level, introducing new troop types and strategies.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The game is designed to be easily accessible with a point-and-click interface, making it suitable for casual gameplay.

## Project Documentation

The repository includes a detailed report structured into several sections:

1. **Analysis:**
   - Problem Identification
   - Stakeholders
   - Scope
   - Research on Similar Games
   - Interviews and Computational Methods

2. **Design:**
   - Game Design Structure
   - Class Diagrams
   - User Interface Design
   - Algorithms and Pre-Development Testing Criteria

3. **Development:**
   - Development Journey (Main Menu, Game Mechanics, AI, etc.)
   - Testing Methods and Stakeholder Testing

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Success Criteria and Evidence
   - Project Limitations and Maintenance Considerations

5. **Appendix:**
   - Code Snippets and Scripts Overview (e.g., `BuildMenu.cs`, `CharacterControll.cs`, `Mining.cs`, etc.)

## Visual Assets

Included in the repository are images that illustrate key components of the game:

- Main Menu Screens
- In-Game Screenshots
- AI Interaction and Gameplay Elements

## How to Access
